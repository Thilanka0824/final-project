**   BlackJack Game   **
************************

-create a user
    -starts with $500
-create a function to add or subtract the n amount of money from the userMoney variable
    -userMoney will start with $500
    -money will added when the user wins, subtracted when they lose
-create a scoreKeeper variable to keep track of how many points each player has.
    -this will determine if the user wins or loses the game 


-create a deck of cards with corresponding blackjack values
    -cards 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 = equal their own numerical value
    -cards 10, Jack, Queen, King = 10 //so i'll use 10, 10, 10, 10
    -Ace is equal to 11 or 1
        -will have to use a conditional to let the user determine if they want an 11 or 1
    -total of 52 cards(13 of each suit)   
-load all the card values into an array that i'll randomize. not sure what to do with the ace(1 or 11)

-use the dealtCards arr to keep track each card that was dealt. 
    -the number of cards removed from the deck will be subtracted from the total number of available cards to be dealt from

-user makes bet (starting value of $50)
    -save bet amount in playerBet variable
        -add/subtract that amount from playerWallet after the hand ends
        -reset playerBet back to $50


-deal the starting cards from shuffledArray 
    -1 to the player, 1 to the dealer, 1 to the player, 1 to the dealer(whole card. will not be visible to player)
-put dealt cards into respective players card array(holds cards to be added up for total score)
-remove dealt cards from shuffleArray (.pop)

** game rules **

-if player has 21(a "natural"), and the dealer does not, he wins 1.5 times their bet

-if the dealer has 21, they collect the bets of every player, that does not have a natural

-if the dealer and a player BOTH have a natural, that players bet is returned

##########################################

-conditional natural 21
    
    -player && dealer
        if(playerTotalScore === 21 && dealerTotalScore === 21){
            push
            add 0 to playerWallet
        }

    -player
        -if(playerTotalScore === 21){
            player wins!
            add bet amount TIMES 1.5 to playerWallet
        
        }

    -dealer
        -if(dealerTotalScore === 21){
            subtract bet amount from all players that don't have 21

        }

-if no naturals are present
  
    while(gameOver = false ){          
        
        -player is asked if they want to "stand" or "hit"
            -if (player === "stand"){
                then continue 
        }
        else if (player === "hit"){
            add first number in shuffleArray to thePlayerCards
            show player their card
            check if(playerCards) has an 11 in it

        }
    
    }


 -if the player the player or dealer has an 11(Ace that could be a 1 or 11), it will need to dynamically change. 
        -prompting the user would be too cumbersome 
        -if playerTotalScore is greater than 10, all incoming aces are equal to 1
        -if the player has an ace, and exceeds 21 on the next card, i'll subtract 10 from the ace
-i'll need to keep track of the ace issue in a separate function and only add to the total score once ace calculations are complete for both sides
        -then add to the totalScore


-if the player chooses to stand AND player score is less than 21
    
-if dealer score is 17 or more, dealer stands.
        -if player score is more than dealer score. player wins
            -adds bet amount to player wallet
            -will need a function to handle all the resets
